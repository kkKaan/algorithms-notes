# Subset Generation

## Overview

Subset generation is a fundamental problem in computer science where the goal is to generate all possible subsets of a given set. This problem can be solved using various techniques, including recursive backtracking and iterative methods.

- Time complexity: $ O(2^n)$, where $n$ is the number of elements in the set.
- Space complexity: $ O(n)$ for the recursion stack in the recursive approach, or $ O(2^n)$ for storing all subsets.

## How It Works (Iterative Approach)

1. Start with an empty subset.
2. For each element in the set, add it to the previously generated subsets to create new subsets.
3. Continue this process until all elements have been considered.
4. The result will be a collection of all subsets, including the empty set and the set itself.

## Pseudocode
```plaintext
function generateSubsets(set):
    subsets = [[]]  // Start with the empty subset
    for element in set:
        // For each element, add it to all existing subsets
        newSubsets = []
        for subset in subsets:
            newSubsets.append(subset + [element])
        subsets.extend(newSubsets)
    return subsets
```
