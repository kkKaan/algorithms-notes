# Sorting Algorithms

This directory contains notes and code implementations for various sorting algorithms. The content is organized into subcategories so that you can easily navigate by sorting type.

## Table of Contents

### 1. Comparison‑Based Sorting
- [Bubble Sort](./comparison-based/bubble_sort/README.md)
- [Selection Sort](./comparison-based/selection_sort/README.md)
- *(Add additional comparison‑based sorts as needed)*

### 2. Hybrid Algorithms
- [Adaptive Merge Sort](./hybrid_algorithms/adaptive_merge_sort/README.md)
- [Intro Sort](./hybrid_algorithms/intro_sort/README.md)
- [Pattern‑defeating Quick Sort](./hybrid_algorithms/pattern-defeating_quick_sort/README.md)
- [Tim Sort](./hybrid_algorithms/tim_sort/README.md)

### 3. Non‑Comparison‑Based Sorting
- [Counting Sort](./non-comparison-based/counting_sort/README.md)
- [Radix Sort](./non-comparison-based/radix_sort/README.md)

### 4. Out‑of‑Core Sorting
- [External Merge Sort](./out-of-core_sorting/external_merge_sort/README.md)

## About This Directory

Each algorithm folder contains:
- **A README.md** with detailed notes: theory, pseudocode, complexity analysis, and example discussion.
- **Implementation files** (in Python, for example) that demonstrate the algorithm in code.
