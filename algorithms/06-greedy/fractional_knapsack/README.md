# Fractional Knapsack

## Overview

Fractional Knapsack is a classic problem in combinatorial optimization. The problem is to maximize the value of items in a knapsack without exceeding the weight capacity. The greedy solution is to sort the items by value-to-weight ratio and add them to the knapsack in order until the capacity is reached.
